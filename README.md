# 🧠 Imbalanced Dataset Classification Project

Welcome! This repository demonstrates how to handle **imbalanced classification problems** using various data resampling techniques and evaluate their impact on model performance.

## 📌 Project Objective

To build a **Logistic Regression classifier** on a highly imbalanced dataset and apply **7 balancing techniques** to improve the model's performance in detecting the minority class.

## 🛠️ Techniques Applied

1. Original Dataset (No Balancing)
2. **Random OverSampling**
3. **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)**
4. **ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling)**
5. **Random UnderSampling**
6. **SMOTE + Tomek Links**
7. **Edited Nearest Neighbors (ENN)**

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

* **Accuracy**
* **Confusion Matrix**
* **Graphical Comparison** of all techniques

## 🔍 Highlights

* Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset (handled missing values, normalized features)
* Applied both over-sampling and under-sampling methods
* Visualized performance comparison using bar charts and heatmaps
* Observed the best results using **SMOTE** and **SMOTE + Tomek Links**

## 🚀 Tools & Libraries

* Python 🐍
* `scikit-learn`
* `imbalanced-learn`
* `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
 

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/imbalanced-classification.git
   cd imbalanced-classification
   ```

2. Install requirements:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run Jupyter notebook or Python script step-by-step to see how models are trained and balanced
